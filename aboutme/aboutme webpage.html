    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="./aboutme webpage_files/myphotosml.jpg">
    <h2>Jose Jarvis</h2>

    <p>I have been married to my beautiful amazing wife, Christy, for 18 years come March. We are 
        blessed with three very unique 12-year old’s, yes triplets! Difficult at times, however would 
        not change a thing about it, they are our world. </p>
     <p> My goal is to get a BS in Applied Technology. I have put my schooling on hold for too long, my 
         own fault, and have always had an interest in computers. I'm here now and excited to keep this 
         ball rolling. I would like to find “my think” in the computer world and run with it. As of now web
         design has my interest however I know that things have a way of changing as life moves forward. 
         I will continue to move forward and be open to new ideas. 
         
     </p><p>I'm currently in my 14th year of law enforcement currently working as a detective in the Crimes 
        Against Children Unit for my department. I have enjoyed most of my time in public service and
        look forward to doing at least 20 years if not more. My faith and testimony has helped me keep an optimistic 
        perspective in the years of seeing what sadness mankind will do to each other. </p> 
          
      <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints practically my whole life, 
         however, I really gained a firmer Testimony when I was about 21 years of age after I joined the
         Marine Corps Reserves. I was blessed to be able to have served a mission for the Church in west 
         during my time in the Marines. They just tagged on two more active reserve years to the end of my
         contract. </p>
