        Working police dogs 
        When it comes to Law Enforcement dogs one thinks of German shepherds and high drive dogs like Belgian Malinois that find fleeing criminals, sniff out drugs, large amounts of cash or even explosives. When one thinks of a police dog the generally do not think of a calm well mannered dog that is there to help with the stress and trauma victims feel and the awkwardness felt during a criminal investigation. The dogs in this setting are called facility dogs, these are highly trained dogs that undergo a strict breeding and training and placement program in order to be utilized in these environments.          </p>
        <p>Service dogs 
          Official service dogs have been around from the early 1900’s and have developed in so many ways. Dogs help people with all kinds of disabilities. Another purpose they serve goes along with their ability to just love unconditionally.  This is where facility dogs come in. These dogs are breed and trained through a long strict process in order to be teamed up with a handler and certified to be called a facility dog.             </p>

      <h3>Dog Breeders</h3>
      <p> 
        Canin Companions for Independence is a national organization that produces these highly trained furry little k9 friends. The process starts with the breeders. A cross the country there are breeders of Labradors, golden retrievers and golden Labrador mix dogs that have been vetted out for this very purpose.  These breeders do this on a volunteer basis for Canina Companions by putting in the work to breed and care for the dogs until the puppies can be weaned from the mother.  After they are weaned, each puppy goes to a puppy raiser where their journey begins.

      <h3>Puppy Raiser</h3>
      <p>
        The puppy raiser are also volunteers all over the country who welcomes a brand-new puppy into their home for next 12 months of their life. This is where the dog starts to learns the basics of what is to come for their purposeful life. All the dogs are crate trained, use voice commands and work on leash. During this time the dogs are also evaluated for any signs of aggression or other behaviors that could be concerning for a working dog. The dogs must learn to listen and respond to commands. The dogs actually enjoy the process as they are trained with positive reinforcement and aim to please. The biggest reward is praise as well as treats, but the praise really goes a long way with these dogs.           </p>
        <h3> Official Training </h3>
        <p>
          At the end of the 18 months the dogs next step is to be taken to a fully equipped facility with professional trainers, and in house vet and groomers. For the next six months the dogs are trained in everything from the basic sit and stay to opening and closing doors, picking up dropped objects, turning lights on and off as well as being accustomed to being relaxed during groomed sessions. By the end of the six months the dogs are trained in up to 30 to 40 commands, depending on the dogs strengths, that can assist persons with disabilities and to be well-mannered enough to work in facility settings such as schools, physical therapy offices, counselors’ office, court houses and Law Enforcements victim advocacy Centers. At approximately the 18 months mark the dog is ready to be teamed up with a handler.  This process is strictly vetted with the persons needs, environment the dog will be in as well as the personality of the handler. Once accepted the person is required to attend a two-week in-house hands-on training where they are matched up with a dog. In the process a person could go through multiple dogs however the training staff generally does well in having a dog picked out by the lengthy questioner the applicant fills out.  Once the teams are matched up and trained, they graduate, are certified go on to their new homes. Follow up certification is required in order to keep their certification as a service dog or facility dog.           </p>
